<!-- I write a [blog](https://rishit-dagli.github.io/). -->

I am mainly interested in learning algorithms, computer vision (visual generation, vision-language models, and neural rendering), learning theory, and math. I have also represented my country in international olympiads. Feel free to talk with me about anything CS, Math, Robotics, or Physics.

<!-- I am currently on a break from my undergrad and work at [NVIDIA Research](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/). -->
I have had the pleasure of working with many awesome people at the University of Toronto. After I switched boats to research I have worked in industry at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research) with [Roland Memisevic](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~memisevr/) and [Guillaume Berger](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=OY4_O9UAAAAJ&hl=en) and at [Civo](https://www.civo.com/) with [Josh Mesout](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mesout).

<!-- At **UofT**, I have been lucky to be supervised by these professors who I admire: [Nandita Vijaykumar](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nandita/), [Rahul G. Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/), [Pascal Tyrrell](https://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca/), [David Lindell](https://davidlindell.com/), and [Houman Khosravani](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=qzhk98YAAAAJ&hl=en). In **industry** after I switched boats to research, I have been lucky to be supervised by these people who I admire: [Roland Memisevic](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~memisevr/) and [Guillaume Berger](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=OY4_O9UAAAAJ&hl=en) from my time at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research), [Josh Mesout](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mesout) from my time at [Civo](https://www.civo.com/). -->
<!-- In **high school**, I have been lucky to be supervised by these people who I admire: [Ali Mustufa](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ialimustufa) and [Prof. Suleyman Eken](https://avesis.kocaeli.edu.tr/suleyman.eken). -->

In a past life, I used to work on software engineering and robotics. I contribute extensively to/ maintain popular open-source projects like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch Foundation](https://pytorch.org/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/), [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) among others. I still work on building a few open-source projects, some of which have been pretty popular. Seeing my work at a rather young age, I was invited to speak at 2 TEDx and 1 TED-Ed events.

<!-- My research community service can be summarized as being a: program committee member for [ICLR Tiny Papers 2023](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForTinyPapers); reviewer for [ICLR PML4DC 2023](https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2023/), [NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc/), [Cloud Native Wasm Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/cloud-native-wasm-day/), and [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc/). -->

<!-- I deeply thank the following organization for current/ in the past supporting my work either through scholarships or research grants or support of some sort: Linux Foundation, Google AI, Google Cloud, University of Toronto, Vector Institute, Stanford, CNCF, and Intel AI. -->
