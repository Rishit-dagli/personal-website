I also maintain [rishit.tech](https://www.rishit.tech) and this is a smaller version of it.

I am a CS Freshman at [The University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/). I love researching and working with Machine Learning, especially Computer Vision. Coming from the software and robotics background, I contribute extensively to/ maintain popular open-source projects like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/), [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) among others. I also love building open-source projects (usually related to Kubernetes and Machine Learning), some of which have been pretty popular which could be found on my GitHub. Seeing my work at a rather young age, I was invited to speak at 2 TEDx and 1 TED-Ed events. Furthermore, I have also represented my country in international olympiads. Feel free to talk with me about anything CS, Math, Robotics, or Physics.

I am advised by [Prof. David Lindell](https://davidlindell.com/) as a part of the [DGP Lab](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/), [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) at the University of Toronto where I research Diffusion. I am currently working as a Research Intern at [Civo Cloud](https://www.civo.com/) researching vision and multimodal models, previously I worked as a research intern at [SpaceX](spacex.com) where I was researching Computer Vision and Machine Learning before which I held the same position on [NASA JWST](https://webbtelescope.org/) (Exoplanet Detection Proposal) before which I have also been a research intern at [Google AI](https://ai.google/) under a grant.

My research community service can be summarized as being a Program Committee member for [ICLR Tiny Papers 2023](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2023/CallForTinyPapers). Reviewer for [ICLR 2023](https://iclr.cc/), [ICLR PML4DC 2023](https://pml4dc.github.io/iclr2023/), [CVPR 2023](https://cvpr2023.thecvf.com/), [ICCV 2023](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/), [ICML 2023](http://icml.cc/) [NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc/), and [Cloud Native Wasm Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/co-located-events/cloud-native-wasm-day/).

As to why I got drawn to Computer Vision, I do believe it is one of the richest modalities but also read this excerpt when I was quite young, from the book, "[Visual Reconstruction](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262524063/visual-reconstruction/)" by Andrew Blake and Andrew Zisserman, some of my favourite researchers:

> We count it a great privilege to be working in a field as exciting as Vision. On the one hand there is all the satisfaction of making things that work - of specifying, in mathematical terms, processes that handle visual information and then using computers to bring that mathematics to life. On the other hand there is a sense of awe (when time permits) at the sheer intricacy of creation. Of course it is the Biological scientists who are right in there; but computational studies, in seeking to define Visual processes in mathematical language, have made it clear just how intrinsically complex must be the chain of events that constitutes "seeing something".

I deeply thank the following organization for current/ in the past supporting my research either through scholarships or research grants: Linux Foundation, Google AI, Google Cloud, University of Toronto, Vector Institute, Stanford, CNCF, and Intel AI.
